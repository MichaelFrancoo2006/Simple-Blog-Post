    <p>Consistency is the key to mastering any skill. Whether it’s coding, writing, or fitness, small daily efforts lead to long-term success. <br> In this post, we explore why consistency matters and how you can apply it in your learning journey.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations." – <strong>James Clear</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Learning something new can feel overwhelming at first. Many people start with excitement but lose motivation along the way. <br> The secret to real progress is not in sudden bursts of effort but in steady, daily practice.</p>

    <p>For example, if you spend just 30 minutes a day coding, in a year, you’ll have accumulated over 180 hours of practice! <br> This principle applies to any field – writing, music, language learning, or fitness.</p>

    <p>Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, start small, stay consistent, and watch yourself improve over time.</p>
